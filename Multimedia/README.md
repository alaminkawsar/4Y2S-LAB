# Multimedia-Lab
This code base provide some compression algorithm that has been practiced in the lab. Algorithms are two type.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Lossless Compression</li>
  <li>Lossy Compression</li>
</ul>

## Lossless Compression
Lossless compression are those compression whose bit streams doesnâ€™t change after decompression.<br>
Following four algorithm hase been implemented: <br>
<ol>
  <li>Run Length Encoding (LRE)</li>
  <li>LZW Dictionary Based Coding</li>
  <li>Huffman Coding</li>
  <li>Arithmetic Coding</li>
</ol>
